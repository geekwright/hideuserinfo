    <p><em>Hide XOOPS core's userinfo.php from anonymous visitors</em></p>

    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p><em>hideuserinfo</em> is a simple XOOPS hack/module which implements a simple SPAM
    registration discouraging feature, preventing the <code>htdocs/userinfo.php</code>
    script from displaying any information to anonymous visitors by intercepting the
    <em>core.userinfo.start</em> event.</p>

    <p>One motivation for SPAM registrations is to put information into the user profile
    which will be indexed by search engines. Even if the spammer never posts on your
    site, the direct link to the user page may be posted elsewhere by the spammer to
    try and use your site's reputation to increase exposure of whatever target they
    are promoting. Hideuserinfo stops the search engines from seeing the profiles.</p>

    <p>The "profile" module has this capability, so this module is only useful if your
    site uses the basic user management built in to XoopsCore.</p>

    <p>If you need legitimate anonymous users to be able to see the user profiles, this won't
    work for your needs -- sorry.</p>
